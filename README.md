# Solution Challenge 2021
## How to Run
Make sure you have React Native 0.63 and Expo 4.1.6 installed. You will also have to set up your own Firebase config in the firebase.js file in `SocialCompetitionApp/src/config` and by setting up a Firebase web project.
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the directory `cd SocialCompetitionApp`
3. Run `yarn ios`

## What It Does
This app keeps grassroots activism fresh and social, addressing UN SDG 10. The UN and many others have made the importance of grassroots movements clear. Social media has the power to organize these movements around the world's biggest problems, yet they rise and fall within weeks; nothing truly ends up changing. Even motivated users simply forget about what's important to them. Why? For one, other content drowns it out. Secondly, if something stays the same for too long on the internet, it is forgotten; the biggest problems in the world can't be solved instantly, and small steps forward don't get attention in the mess of current social media.

So that's what we tackled:

**We streamline the content:** communities are organized around different good causes, featuring a post format that puts visual content, captions, links, and sharing front and center to make connecting with causes natural. At the request of our users, they can choose to be anonymous or not, so they are free to express their opinions and have thoughtful discussions.

**We quantify and visualize every action:** users can track their own impact through a gamification system with points, auto-generated milestones to encourage each individual, and highlighting the impact of recent actions in plain English. The most impactful users are featured to the community. We let people share both their own progress and others' posts in a highly visual format, so our community's reach is not isolated.

Our social app helps users focus on smaller goals and activity within the larger issues they care about. **We make it clear that every step counts.** This is a platform that creates impactful grassroots communities that don't fizzle out for no good reason.

## Development
We built the frontend in React Native with JavaScript since we all knew JavaScript. This allowed us to focus our efforts on creating the experience users want, including a robust backend system built in Google Firebase, with authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions, and Cloud Messaging. We also used the Google Cloud API to auto-tag posts and make posting more seamless.

We conducted weekly user testing with interested college students that included the following: idea selection, design, UI, desired settings and privacy, most valuable and interesting content to view and post, effectiveness of the gamification system, and full app experience.
